Our workshop training material is open source. Here is a selection:

- [Write Yourself A CLI](https://github.com/corrode/write-yourself-a-cli): Your first steps writing a simple, but working Rust CLI application following all the best-practices.
- [Write Yourself A Web-App](https://github.com/corrode/write-yourself-a-web-app): Write a small weather app, which reads data from an external API and presents it as HTML.
- [Write Yourself A Shell](https://github.com/corrode/write-yourself-a-shell): Learn how shells work in a playful way by writing one yourself in Rust.

We will use the Rust standard library and learn how to do most things by ourselves.
The focus is on getting a solid grasp for the language.
